A new time is coming and an operation looms. A new knee is right around the corner
The need to be careful in preparation for the surgery curtails normal activity and work.
The stress of making sure I have no scratches or bruises near the operation site is making day to day life a lot harder.
The stress doesn't allow for clear thinking which causes carelessness, a vicious circle. 
Hopefully, 
The operation will proceed, the end result will happen, and life will continue.
While I can't guarantee the surgery or end results, I can guarantee life,
in all its majesty and glory, will happen. 
The sun will rise and fall, the tides will rise and fall  
The rooster will crow, and life will continue on.
As a wizard of pretty good reputation, I have seen the power of life and how brightly it shines in a very cold and dark universe against a raging backdrop of life.
One small planet, in a lonely galaxy in a cosmic cluster filled with galaxy's 
that screams with the life beacon.  
All of this incredible beauty only goes to show,
that stress and stressing are ridiculous when compared to all of the wonder that life and the universe .
 nox frigida caelum errantem veneficus ad lacrimas affert
The cold night sky brings a wandering wizard to tears.
