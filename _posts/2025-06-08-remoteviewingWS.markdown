 Remote viewing what is it and how does it work: 
WHAT IS REMOTE VIEWING: Remote viewing in its simplest format, it is the ability to see a location in time and space. However, this is overly simplified.
Why learn about remote viewing:
1.	To have fun and see the world thru a different lens
2.	Exploring new avenues to learn about the world
3.	Use as personal help tool
4.	Use to help others
5.	Most learn it for what they can discover about themselves.

TRAINING/PRACTISE: HOW TO START:
Process:
1.	Area to focus
2.	Acquiring a blind target
3.	Documenting what you feel, see, taste, hear and smell, using your five senses
4.	Drawing
5.	Feedback
#1 - (Remember only allow 1-2 seconds per impression).
Write the target number and without lifting the pen - create your first instinctive impression

#2. Repeat as needed
Write the target number and without lifting the pen - create your second instinctive impression

#3 Next: Write down your sensory impressions called gestalts:
SOUNDS: What do you hear?
TEXTURES: What do you feel, is it rough, smooth, wet ect
TEMPERATURE:
LUMINESCENCE
SMELLS: Is it moldy, sweet, humid, earthy ect
TASTE:
DIMENSIONS:
IMPACT: How is it making you feel, try to keep it at a single impression
#4 Next is time to sketch: Write down the target # again, focus on it for a few seconds and then start drawing, be sure to write down any gestalts on parts of your drawing to give further information on those areas as you feel them.
Last step would be to write a summary of what you believe the target is.
