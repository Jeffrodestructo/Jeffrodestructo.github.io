My website is Screaming into the night LLC, you might ask why? Let me tell you—I came to this title because we all get that little voice that tells us to run away screaming, but do we listen to it, hell no. I became involved with remote viewing to study or at least try to understand this phenomena and it opened my eyes to a whole new way of looking at the world (and unseen world) around us. I have met people who can see and do amazing things. I hope to introduce you to this new frontier.

 Additionally I have a youtube channel where I explore many new things [Screamingintothenight](http://webjeda.com/gatok/about/).
