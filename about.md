My website is Screaming into the night LLC, you might ask why? Let me tell youâ€”I came to this title because we all get that little voice that tells us to run away screaming, but do we listen to it, hell no. I became involved with remote viewing to study or at least try to understand this phenomena and it opened my eyes to a whole new way of looking at the world (and unseen world) around us. I have met people who can see and do amazing things. I hope to introduce you to this new frontier.

 Additionally I have a youtube channel where I explore many new things [Screamingintothenight](https://www.youtube.com/@jeffjones-fv3ds).
